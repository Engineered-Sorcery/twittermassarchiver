Twitter Mass Archiver

This is a simple, no-frills tool for the archival of media from Twitter created in the hopes of storing art and information lest Twitter were to cease to exist.

Requirements:

Python 3.18.x in path


Operation Instructions:

Place the contents of the TwitterMassArchiver repository in the folder where you wish for your media to be saved
Run archive.py (either through windows: 'open with->Python' or through the commandline command python3 archive.py)

Paste the *base* twitter links of your desired archive media (for example 'http://www.twitter.com/[username]/status/[number]' with no trailing tags. Anything including and after a question mark should be removed)

Separate links with a new-line (press enter/return on keyboard)

Once all links are added, click "ok"





TODO: 

Add path config option
